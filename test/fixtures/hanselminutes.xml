            <description>Kyle Simpson, aka @getify, is the Curriculum Manager for MakerSquare and has created a series of books called You Don't Know JS. You can read the You Don't Know JS book series for free on GitHub, but we know you'll want to buy them after you hear this interview. Kyle sets Scott straight and explains why Scott doesn't know JavaScript. It's true, he really doesn't...at least not as well as he thought!</description>

            <description>Scott talks with former Googler Kenton Varda about his startup Sandstorm.io. Sandstorm makes it easy to run and manage your own server by simplifying application deployment and security. How does it work and how does it relate to Docker?

            <description>There's lots of discussion around assistive technology on the web, but what about technologies that aren't all about the browser? There are a number of conditions that have made it easier to develop assistive technology (social media, crowdfunding, rapid prototyping tools,etc.) Scott talks to Sylvia Richardson, an accessibility coordinator for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina about some of the many innovations in this space.</description>

            <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
            <description>Scott talks with coder, tinkerer, and occasional adjunct professor Dawn C Hayes about the intersection of physical computing and creating coding. As we write code more, we have to ask ourselves "but are we improving our world? The community? Our culture?" The advent of wearables, augmented games, and networked objects has the potential to take computing out of the garage and into the collective consciousness. Dawn teaches Scott about how these objects can combine with new thinking around informal learning to engage not only new audiences but the next generation of creator.</description>
